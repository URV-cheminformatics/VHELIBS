After performing the automatic analysis and classification of a target's binding site and ligand, it then enables the user to graphically review and compare them with their EDM in order to make it easier to properly classify any 'dubious'-labelled structure or re-classify any other structure based on actual graphical fitting of the EDM with the model.\r\n\r\nVHELIBS aims to enable non-crystallographers and users with little or no crystallography knowledge to easily validate and use reliable structures in drug discovery and development. To that end, it features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which makes it easy to tune the parameters for more advanced users, but  also comes with carefully chosen  default values that are valid for most situations.","name":"VHELIBS"}
